List of amateur radio topics meant to compliment the Mastodon Radio tag #1001nightsinAmateurRadio.

The author, Sandip EI7IJB, follows the excellent podcast called 'Foundations of Amateur Radio' by Onno VK6FLAB. This is a byte sized podcasts that are meant to entertain, think, be inspired and take action. **Please take a moment to follow 'Foundations of Amateur Radio' podcast on your podcast app of choice.**

In a recent episode called 'Doing the same thing over and over again ...' dated 2023-04-29, Onno mentions there are thousands of topics that an operator can choose from if they believe they need something new to be passionate about. He encourages the listener / operator to explore new topics because we cannot say where the inspiration for an idea can come from.

Inspired by both Onno's podcast and 1001 Arabian stories, the author had decided to start this reading project, where the operator would read a single topic every day for an hour or less preferably before bed for the next 1001 days. The idea is that the operator might find a new subject that they can become passionate about and hopefully inspire others to start thinking outside their RF space.

The reading list is updated every Sunday, giving the operator 7 new topics to read in the following week. 

The author acknowledges that there is a full family life outside this hobby and delays can be expected.

The author is always thankful for all feedback on this project and any new topics to be included to the reading list. These can be shared via Mastodon Radio by searching for the tag #1001nightsinAmateurRadio.
